# Update
Just for explanation:
1. The druglabelshow, drugshow and dosingguidelineshow are the actual classes used for showing and matching for the change of the database. Those old ones like durg, drugshow and dosingguideline classes are left becasue there are some dependencies that have not been finished  cleaning during the test.

2.  We adopted new tables in the database and sql command for creating and insering data are appended in the sql directory.
